Heat Exchangers have a vital role in any industry. One of the popular
types of them is Finned-Plate Heat Exchangers. Finned plate heat
exchangers have several industrial applications due to their high heat
transfer rates and compact design. Some of these applications include:

> 1-HVAC Systems: Finned plate heat exchangers are commonly used in
> heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to transfer
> heat between fluids. They are particularly effective in air
> conditioning systems where the temperature difference between
> refrigerants and air is negligible. 2-Refrigeration: Finned plate heat
> exchangers are used in refrigeration systems to transfer heat between
> the refrigerant and the surrounding environment. They are commonly
> used in refrigeration systems for supermarkets, food processing
> plants, and other industrial applications.
>
> 3-Power Generation: Finned plate heat exchangers are used in power
> generation systems to transfer heat between fluids, such as cooling
> water and steam. They are commonly used in power plants, which help
> improve efficiency and reduce operating costs.
>
> 4-Chemical Processing: Finned plate heat exchangers are used in
> chemical processing plants to transfer heat between fluids. Their
> usage is in applications where the fluids have different viscosities,
> densities, or thermal conductivities.
>
> 5-Oil and Gas: Finned plate heat exchangers are used in the oil and
> gas industry to transfer heat between fluids. They are commonly used
> in gas processing plants, refineries, and other industrial
> applications.

In this study, we aim to show the temperature distribution in each
element of this H.Ex by 1D, 3D, Contour, Heatmap, and imagesc plot. Our
other goals are calculating the lost heat and finding an optimized
length for each fin to reduce the heat loss.
